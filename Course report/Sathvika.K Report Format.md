|<h3> Mini Projects</h3>
| Mini Project1: To-Do List Application  
The To-Do List application implemented in Python features two main classes: Todo_Item for individual tasks and Todo_List  for managing collections of tasks. Each task can have a priority (High, Medium, Low) and a completion status (done or not). The application allows users to create, finish, delete, search, and list tasks based on various criteria. Sample usage demonstrates the functionalities, showcasing effective task management and organization.    | https://github.com/sure-trust/KAMISETTY-SATHVIKA-g32-python/blob/main/Mini%20projects/To_do/todo.py                        |
|Mini Project2: Binary Classification using Logistic Regression
This mini project implements a binary classification model using logistic regression. The model utilizes a sigmoid activation function to predict probabilities for binary outcomes. The training process involves calculating the binary cross-entropy loss, updating the model weights and bias using gradient descent, and evaluating accuracy metrics. The project demonstrates the core principles of logistic regression and provides insights into the model's performance over multiple training epochs.                                                                             |  https://github.com/sure-trust/KAMISETTY-SATHVIKA-g32-python/blob/main/Mini%20projects/binary_classification.ipynb |
|Mini Project3: Iris Dataset Analysis with Decision Tree Classifier
This mini project employs a Decision Tree Classifier to examine the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with features such as sepal and petal dimensions. After preprocessing the data, the classifier was trained, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 100%. The decision tree comprised three leaves with a maximum depth of two, highlighting the importance of SepalLength and PetalWidth in species classification. | https://github.com/sure-trust/KAMISETTY-SATHVIKA-g32-python/blob/main/Mini%20projects/decision1.ipynb |
| Mini Project 4: Wine Quality Prediction using KNN
This mini project processes the Wine Quality dataset to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties. After preprocessing the data and categorizing quality into "Below Average," "Average," and "Above Average," a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach is implemented to predict the quality of new wine samples. The predictions for three sample wines indicate one as "Above Average" and the other two as "Average," demonstrating the model's effectiveness in evaluating wine characteristics.  |https://github.com/sure-trust/KAMISETTY-SATHVIKA-g32-python/blob/main/Mini%20projects/knn.ipynb |
|Mini Project5: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  
This mini project involves building a linear regression model to predict house prices and grades using the KC_house dataset. The project includes data preprocessing (standardization of features), model development (implementing linear regression from scratch), and optimization using gradient descent. It also visualizes the training loss over epochs to evaluate model performance. By the end, the model effectively predicts housing prices based on various features, providing insights into the relationship between them. | https://github.com/sure-trust/KAMISETTY-SATHVIKA-g32-python/blob/main/Mini%20projects/mulitlinear_regression%201.ipynb |
|Mini Project6: Mushroom Edibility Classification using Naive Bayes
This mini project develops a Naive Bayes classifier to predict mushroom edibility using the Mushroom dataset from Kaggle, containing 8,124 entries and 23 features. After preprocessing the data, a 'predict' function calculates conditional probabilities for classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous. The model achieves 100% accuracy on 1,000 test samples, showcasing the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes classifier for this classification task.| https://github.com/sure-trust/KAMISETTY-SATHVIKA-g32-python/blob/main/Mini%20projects/naive_bayes.ipynb |
|<h3>Final Project</h3>
|Raisin Classification using TensorFlow
In this project, TensorFlow is used to implement a logistic regression model to classify two types of raisins: Kecimen and Besni. The dataset contains features such as area, perimeter, compactness, and length, which serve as inputs for the model. Using TensorFlow's efficient computation, the logistic regression algorithm learns to predict the probability of each raisin type based on these features. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix to ensure reliable classification between the two raisin varieties.  | https://github.com/sure-trust/KAMISETTY-SATHVIKA-g32-python/blob/main/Final%20capstone%20project/sample.ipynb  |
